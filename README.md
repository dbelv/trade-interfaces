# Valorem Exchange Protobuf 

The Valorem Exchange uses gRPC services and protobuf to achieve fast and 
efficient communication. This repository contains the protobuf definitions and 
related documentation.

Of particular interest is the protobuf wire format for the 
[Seaport](https://github.com/ProjectOpenSea/seaport) marketplace, which underlies
the Valorem Exchange.
